        <h1>About this website</h1>
        <section>
          
        </section>
      <p><strong>First of all, thanks for visiting my site.</strong> This is my personal website for 18 years now. It is and has been one of the blogs that are still active in the Spanish-speaking world, now written in English. Back then, when blogs dominated the internet scene, this was the most read blog in the Hispanic sphere and then shared its share of readers with the rest of excellent blogs that appeared between 2001 and 2007, which is when I started to leave my activity as a blogger and became more of a sort of Twitter based publisher.</p>

<p>Today, after so many years of inactivity in this blog, I dedicate myself to publishing my writings about history, some studies or projects that can serve the community of developers or designers. I spend a lot of time learning new things more than writing and behaving like an “influencer”.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-design-of-this-website">About the design of this website</h3>

<p>This website was meant to be readen. It is also inspired in the old famous Jackob’s Nielsen useit.com because I loved that website and everything around it. That’s why you see this kind of design. It is pretty functional even if you think it doesn’t. Data has shown over the years this kind of design trumps over the hyped, overproduced designs I did. You can check, if you want, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010901000000*/minid.net">the entire history of the blog and it’s designs</a> go for it.</p>

<h3 id="how-everything-started">How everything started</h3>

<p>The first record I have of this blog was in 1998, when this site was hosted in a different domain. While I still had no idea that I was “a blogger” or “blogging” itself, my personal page was rather a site where I could watch a capture of my daily webcam, two or three lines of update of what I had done. I did not have the basic components of a blog, nor was it advertised as such.</p>

<p>In 1999 I started writing development articles, mainly, attacking Macromedia Flash and advocating for the Web Standards. The site was not yet hosted on its own server and under this domain. I quickly became ostracized by the development community and the designers at that time, because everyone loved Flash and was criticizing their way of doing business. Even with all the aggressiveness received, over time I became popular and people began to understand my position on the adoption of web standards and why it was best for everyone. Today many people who are still developing thank me.</p>

<p>At the end of March 2001, I established this domain as a permanent home for my identity and all my knowledge. In a matter of months, it was the most read blog in spanish, receiving a large number of daily visits that directly measured using unique pages served. At the best moment of the blog, this site served 1.5 million unique pages a day. Even being a blog, programming using absolute strictness in terms of standards, my problem was still the network bandwidth. To my friends who kindly gave me their servers and felt the fire, to this day I am still grateful.</p>

<p>For the year 2007, in my life began professional changes that took me away from the activity of blogging. Soon the commercial blogs took control of everything and new forms of communication were born propitiated the end of my activity as a blogger. By then, I was already posting periodically on Twitter and Facebook, which also brought me an incredible number of readers, and occasionally, I wrote on my blog.</p>

<p>Now the site is still active, and my personal proposal is to continue writing and publishing all the possible material that I made between 2010 and today. There is a lot of interesting material that I would like to make clear in the blog.</p>

<h3 id="things-that-werent-true">Things that weren’t true</h3>

<p>There are some topics about me or this website that were not true. For example, that <strong>this was the first blog of Argentina</strong>. It’s a bold claim, but back then, we were spread a lot and it was difficult to certify which one had the honor. I can certify I was between the 2nd or the 3rd blog in Argentina, and also my colleague and friend <a href="https://www.uberbin.net/">Mariano Amartino</a> was one of the pioneers of blogging to, to this day he still keeps blogging!. Both blogs I’ve seen with earlier posts than mine were dubious to my eyes. Anyways, it’s something I never cared of but people always liked to banter about.</p>

<p>There were rumors also about my behavior with other famous bloggers. Like I hated Eduardo Arcos, Mariano Amartino or others bloggers in general. So far from that, those were and still are great people I never had problems with. But, truth to be told, we had differences in opinions over topics, but never, never went personal.</p>

<p>The other rumor was I was obsessed with visits, activity in my blog. Again, so far from the truth: i never cared about it. It was my friends who told me “wow, i’ve got this much of visits thanks to your link”. I checked stats once and then, but never cared, till the point i removed Google Analytics around the year 2005. I was more obssesed to cover the network bandwith requirements to keep my blog alive. Till this day I don’t care and this blog doesn’t do any type of tracking.</p>

<p>This is not a rumor, it’s a truth: I have quit Facebook, Instagram and most of the social networks because, you know, in this new era of political correctness, not all opinions are welcomed. So, I don’t belong to places where I can be censored. You still can message me on Twitter at @minid, but I don’t post anymore there.</p>

<h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>
